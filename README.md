# Drawing-with-Fourier-Transform

This is my attemp at making a programme to trace out a path using multiple vectors rotating at different frequencies.

To use it, you need to enter you data, i.e. coordinates of points, in the Path.csv file in the correct order.
If you wish to draw the shape, you can do so by using draw.py in repo.
In the end, use main.py to see it moving and also to save the image.

To make it more accurate, you can increase the variable 'terms' But it also takes more time to load as the number of terms increase.
